# PersonalWebsite-PrineshBansal
Personal website created for CS5610

# Assignment Requirements
For this assignment, I have created an Single Page Application (SPA). Below are the various requirements that the portfolio website fulfills.

## Landing Page 
The first page that the user visits when accessing the website is is index.html which specifies a basic portfolio foir myself. The page gives a succinct description about me and lists all attributes that are essential to a portfolio like education, experience, and projects

## Navigational Elements & Internal Links
It contains a header bar which is fixed in position and can be used for quickly accessing all internal links to navigate through the website's sections
